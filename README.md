Features
--------
**Moderatly minimal install:**
Not quite [suckless](https://suckless.org) Level, but minimal enough to
lightweight, quick to install, while still having applications accomplish
everyday tasks. 

**Notifications with icons for system information:**
Information about system functions will be presented in the form of
notifications. Most, if not all key-bindings will notify you of any background
processes, or if anything has gone wrong.

Install
-------
***USE AT YOUR OWN RISK***
Copy all files into your home directory.

Documentation
-------------
The man pages are usually the best place to go as community support with swaywm
are limited, except for asking your questions on 
[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/swaywm) or the *#sway* IRC channel, there are
very few forms online detailing issues that users have had and how to fix them.
This may be a good thing though, as it forces you to get used to reading
documentation and troubleshooting for yourself.

Here are some useful links for learning about what you can do with sway:

Wacom drawing tablets
---------------------
Wacom tablets work in sway, though you need to compile the driver from source
as there are some current issues with the version in the arch repositories
for some reason.
