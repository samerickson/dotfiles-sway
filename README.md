DOTFILE PROJECT | MASTER BRANCH [SWAYWM]
========================================
This project is interned to provide new Linux users with the information needed to 
modify their environment using scripts and configuration files in order to improve 
their workspace efficiency and be able to program faster.

Branch information
------------------
This is the master branch containing my 
[tiling window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager) of choice. 
For more information: [why use a tiling window manager?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj1IfdKY0CU).

Current known issues
--------------------
- Volume buttons also do not work, currently using pavucontrol manually.
- gtk input boxes are blurry, i.e when entering gpg pass phrases.
