[tiling window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager) of choice.

Current known issues
--------------------
- Volume buttons also do not work, currently using pavucontrol manualy.
- Firefox has a flickering issue, currently using `fedora-firefox-wayland-bin`.
- gtk input boxes are blurry, i.e when entering gpg passphrases.

List of current branches

- **Master:** This is my main branch with the intention of being as applicable to creating a nice software development enviournment that does not install an insane amount of packages and configuration files that everything becomes a hot mess of copy and pasted code.
- [minimal-sway](https://github.com/samerickson/dotfiles/tree/minimal-sway): This branch serves as what I concider the bare minimum for a useable system running Arch linux and [swaywm](https://swaywm.org/).
